# VENI
## Motivation
VENI is a company that a few students from National Chiao Tung University came up with 
for a course on Technology Entrepeneursip. 
The site would offer ways to support up-and-coming online creators and backers
would gain some extra perks for doing so.
We decided that it would be a good idea to start learning about web technologies
and so we wanted to make some version of VENI.
